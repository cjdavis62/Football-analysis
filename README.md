# Football-analysis
Schedule analyzer for football scores in fantasy.

With this script, you can determine the rank of a player during the season.

This script is run w/ python3 as:
> `python3.X analyzer.py -p P` 

Where `X` is the version of python3 installed and `P` is the player code.
You can find the code for players with the `-l` extension.

Planned update: I'll update this project to be able to determine the rank of the player throughout all possible permutations of the schedule, and then plotting a histogram of their rank in each.
